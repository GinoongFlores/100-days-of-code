**Today's Progress**: I finished coding the content on my technical documentation page in freecodecamp.org, and I started to style it with CSS.

**Today's Progress**: Styling the content in my technical documentatio page in freecodecamp.org. I style the colors in code using the element span in HTML on the conten of Java for loop to Java Booleans. 

**Thoughts**: Sometimes it's overwhelming to style using span because I have to use many spans in every code that is showed on my technical page. The example given from the freecodecamp was there is no style on every code, but I just wanted my code to be unique, and I think will inherit some style from the example, like putting the links on the right side and stack them.
